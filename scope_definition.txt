14. Williams Game and Co. would combine the elements of two systems. It would be both parts a Transaction Processing
and Management Information system. Because of the services and products that the company sells to the consumers and
clients, everyday transactions need to be recorded. The TPS will keep track of any transaction that takes place with 
Williams Game and Co. and any client or supplier; whether online or in person. The MIS will be a working inventory of
all of the company's products. Everytime a transaction happens, a customer buys or picks up a game, a supplier delivers 
a shipment of new products, or a product is returned to one of the stores by a customer, the system is updated immediately,
if not almost immediately.

 15. The company needs this system because it will be able to update the comapany's inventory at a great speed, saving the
company and the workers time and work. It would almost eliminate the need for a physical count.

16. In order the design this system, we would need a count of all of the present existing inventory of all of the company's
products, the different values of all of the products, and the cost of shipping and receiving products to clients and from suppliers.
This should take 1-2 weeks to fully complete.

17.Hiring people, buying software, and buying hardware would accounted for. People need to be paid and hired to create the algorithms
and code for the system. Whatever software the builders and designers need has to be bought the final system wouldhave to burnedon CDs
,which also have to be bought, and distributed to the different sites. The estimated cost would be 3 months.

18.The people included to make all of theis happen would be sales associates to count on hand inventory and managers to collect the data
and forward it to the designers. The designers then use that information to help create the system and give the information to the builders.
A total of 30 associates, 6 managers, 7 designers and 6 builders.
