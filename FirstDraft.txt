The name of my company is called Williams Game Co., a NYC exclusive shop for video games and related software and 
hardware. Williams Game Co. has 5 locations throughout New York City, two locations in Manhatten, two in Queens and 
one in Brooklyn. Each location would have 3 managers and 15 employees to rotate from day to day. Products sold by 
Williams Game Co. include video games, consoles, any hardware for the consoles. The gross annual income will come from
the sales of products (games range from $30-$60, consoles range from $120-$400). Employees would be paid $9.00/hr, managers
will make $15.00/hr and all will be paid bi-weekly. Including an estimate for miscellenious expenses (repairs to stores, 
paying suppliers, etc) annual income is ~$3.5 million. Most transactions from the company will be selling the different products
on the floor. Others will include buying items back from customers, placing orders and exchanges. Throughput for the company
will be mainly customer orders and emailing suppliers about restock and transactions with them. Our clients will be any person 
who has any level of interest with video games. Our suppliers are video game publishers and console manufactuers
